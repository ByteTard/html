# Bootstrap Forum Site

A simple Bootstrap-based website with a login page and forum for blog-style posts.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to start.

## Usage
- **Login**: Use username `admin` and password `password` (hardcoded for demo).
- **Forum**: Create and view posts after logging in.
- Posts are stored in the browser's `localStorage` (clears on cache reset).

## Hosting on GitHub Pages
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Go to Settings > Pages, select the `main` branch, and save.
3. Access at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo/`.

## Extending with a Backend
For real authentication and persistent posts, add a backend (e.g., Node.js, Flask) and host on a server like Heroku or AWS.
